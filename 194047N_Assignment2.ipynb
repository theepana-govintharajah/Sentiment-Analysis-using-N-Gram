For some, the film's content and execution leave much to be desired, making it a polarizing cinematic experience. Viewer reactions may vary widely, so it's a movie that evokes strong opinions on both ends of the spectrum.\n",

But for sentiment analysis small value of N is enough. And also due to small dataset we can't go for N>=3, it's better to go with unigram or bigram.
